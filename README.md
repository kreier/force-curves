# Force-curves of 1473 switches

This is a [fork](https://github.com/ThereminGoat/force-curves) of the work from https://www.theremingoat.com/.

## Comparison website

Three larger projects to collect switch force curves are from [HaaTa](https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~haata#/), [ThereminGoat](https://github.com/ThereminGoat/force-curves) and [bluepylons](https://github.com/bluepylons/Open-Switch-Curve-Meter). In [January 2023](https://deskthority.net/viewtopic.php?t=27819) a member of [Deskthority](https://deskthority.net/) forum (with their [wiki page](https://deskthority.net/wiki/)) created a website to view and compare more than 2200 switches:

## A Beginner’s Guide to Force Curves

A comprehensive explanation of the custom-build mechanical keyboard is written by Andy Doering on [his github page](https://github.com/AndyDoering/Keyboards) from 2021. There is a great article on [ThereminGoat's Switches website](https://www.theremingoat.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-force-curves) as a Beginner’s Guide to Force Curves.

## Original message from theremingoat

Hey all,

This is officially the home of all of the force curve documents as well as raw data that I first introduced into my content on May 29th of 2022. In addition to these force curves being included as a regular part of long form reviews since that date, this repository contains a significant number of switches which I otherwise would not/will not cover in other forms on my website. If you are new to this repository, note that each switch's folder will contain an easily readable PDF file that dispays force curves, an XLSX sheet which has processed data that was used to construct those curves, and a raw CSV file if you would like to use that data yourself.

My only request regarding this data is that if you choose to use it in any capacity that I am credited in some way or another. Do not necessarily feel inclined to reach out, as simply stating that this is ThereminGoat's data and/or linking to any of my content would be plenty fine with me.

The aim as of starting this folder is to update it roughly weekly and to catalogue a rather substantial portion of my collection in time.

Cheers,

-Goat
